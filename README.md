# grow2 prototype

## Notes

- Implements client-side page rendering.
- Resolves YAML and templates in-browser.
- Implements basic routing.
- Stubs for gettext.

## What else to prototype

- First party objects for text (i.e. `!g.text`).
- Node-based implementation of `grow build` equivalent (on CLI).
- Localization (i.e. localized routing, text translation).
- Localization in YAML (do we do this with `@<locale>` again?)
